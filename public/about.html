  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Name's Daniel, nice to meet you! I was born and raised in <span style="color: green;">Brazil</span> and currently
    I'm learning about front-end development through my college degree in System Development. My dream is to become a
    full-time front-end programmer and eventually start living in Australia in order to achieve a higher quality of life
    for me and my family.</p>
